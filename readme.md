# andryou facebook cleaner
A userscript that allows people to quickly clean their Facebook account. The ability to Purge and/or Hide all activity (posts, photos, videos, votes, likes, tags, mentions) is offered.

Note: due to the nature of this script (irreversible deletion), tread accordingly.

## Features
* Activates all years and months before proceeding to ensure it doesn't miss any activity
* Purging - very thorough, will remove even tags/mentions. Will not unfriend anyone or tamper with your relationships.
* Hiding - will hide all hideable activity items.
* Other userscripts mark posts as spam in an attempt to hide/remove them. The Hide feature in this userscript will unmark them as spam (and hide them).
* Code is fully available for scrutiny/review

## To Use
Install Tamper Monkey (Chrome) or Greasemonkey (Firefox).

## License
* You are free to do whatever you want with the code
